# ImageOps
This Java assignment is Eclipse project structure and is exported such as well. The "SRC" folder contains the source file
"ImageOps.java" and the JUnit test file "ImageOpsTest.java". The "BIN" folder contains the compiled class files from the 
source files. The source files have comments stating usage of every method and class an are self-explaiatory. I have used the 
ABSTRACT WINDOW TOOLKIT (AWT) API of Java for graphics related elements like drawing and geometric shapes and SWING GUI TOOLKIT
to display the images and the operations carried on them. I have used concurrent TimeUnit to delay between different frames.
Since the project is Eclipse project structure it can be imported as is.
